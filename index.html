        <h1>How did I started?</h1>
        <p>
          I started my programming journey in 2022, I made my first project in JavaScript who was a discord bot multi-functional (currently discontinued), then I started learning some about Java, I tried to make a game in Unity but I didn't have the patience for it, so I started learning web development, I loved it. This is my first serious web, I hope you like it!
